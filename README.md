## React Fundamental Concepts Used

This project utilizes the following React fundamental concepts:

- **Components:** Functional components for building UI elements.
- **State Management:** Using `useState` for managing local component state.
- **Effect Hook:** Using `useEffect` for side effects such as data fetching.
- **Props:** Passing data to components via props.
- **React Router:** Implementing routing to navigate between product detail pages.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Displaying different UI elements based on application state (loading, error, no products found).
- **Event Handling:** Managing user interactions through button clicks.

## Data Handling and Management

- **Data Fetching:** Products are fetched from a local JSON file using the Fetch API.
- **State Management:** Local state management is handled using React's `useState` hook. 

> Note: If you have additional data management features like Context API or local storage, be sure to mention them here.
